## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Georgia State University focused on building systems for algorithmic trading and real-time data visualization. I care about performance, clarity, and making things work at scale. Most of my work revolves around automation, market behavior, and interactive data systems. What I appreciate most is designing systems that create measurable, real-world impact.
