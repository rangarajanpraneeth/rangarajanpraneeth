## About Me

I'm a Computer Science student at Georgia State University with a focus on building systems like algorithmic trading bots and real-time data visualization. I care about performance, clarity, and making things work at scale. Most of what I build revolves around automation, market behavior, and interactive computational systems. What I appreciate the most is designing systems that have a real impact in a way you can measure.

## My Projects

### Algorithmic Trading Framework
A practical trading engine built around price-action-based signal generation, market structure and liquidity analysis, and adaptive execution logic that reacts to momentum and pressure.

Features include modular candle and volume analytics, structural break detection, liquidity sweep mapping, live risk metrics, and a bespoke backtesting framework.

### Sim Racing Telemetry Dashboard
A real-time pipeline for ACC that handles high-frequency data acquisition, custom parsing and state tracking, and low-latency rendering of key performance metrics.

Features include live pace and consistency analysis, braking and throttle behavior mapping, sector deltas, timing breakdowns, driver input tracking, and dashboard components designed for clarity.
